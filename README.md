# sjplus-ripper 
A bit of code I wrote to automatically rip images from [Shonen Jump+](https://shonenjumpplus.com/).

## Usage:

1. Visit the website linked above and open a chapter you want to save
2. Open Inspect Element (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I), paste this in the console and enter
3. ???
4. Profit

## Notes:

- This is just a little script I made so I could read chapters offline. Please don't reupload these chapters elsewhere so as to not get into legal trouble.
- I haven't paid for any chapters so I'm not sure what happens if use this on one, lmk if it doesn't work üëç It definitely won't work if you haven't paid for it though.
